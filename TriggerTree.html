<u>Trigger Tree Plugin</u><br>
<br>
The plugin provides another interface to the Custom Triggers. Triggers
can be managed from either interface.<br>
<br>
The left panel lists each Category. The right panel lists all triggers
in the selected Category.<br>
<br>
Features that are similar to the Custom Trigger Tab include:<br>
<ul>
<li>Active triggers are green text.</li>
<li>Enabled but inactive triggers (e.g. you are not currently
in the restricted zone) are black text.</li>
<li>Disabled triggers (i.e. unchecked,&nbsp;they will never
alert)
are grey text.</li>
<li>The checkbox next to the trigger will enable / disable the
trigger.</li>
<li>Right-click a Category or trigger to get a context menu,
e.g. for sharing.</li>
</ul>
Additional features over the Custom Trigger tab include:<br>
<ul>
<li>Category Panel</li>
<ul>
<li>When entering a zone that has a matching Category, the
Category is automatically selected.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Perform an incremental search for a Category by entering
text in the <i>Find:</i> box. The [Enter] key or the
double arrow button
performs a 'find next'.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>To support writing a new trigger after having left the
zone, the
context menu provides a 'Copy category name to clipboard'.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>If the Category name and triggers can be written to an
EQII macro, the context menu allows saving all the triggers and spell
timers in that Category to a macro for sharing in EQII. &nbsp;See
the section on <a href="#macro_share">macro limitations</a>.</li>
</ul>
<li>Trigger Panel</li>
<ul>
<li>Displays the triggers for the selected category.</li>
<li>Trigger details are sub-items of the Regular Expression.</li>
<li>If the Category name and trigger can be written to an
EQII macro, the
context menu allows saving&nbsp;the trigger and its spell timer to
a macro for sharing in EQII. &nbsp;Triggers and spell timers that
can be written to a macro file are indicated by the 'macro play' icon
next to their checkbox. See the section on <a href="#macro_share">macro
limitations</a>.</li>
<li>Double-click the <i>Alert</i> or&nbsp;<i>Timer
or Tab Name</i> sub-items
to open an edit dialog for just those settings.</li>
<li>Double-click the&nbsp;<i>Trigger Timer</i>
to open ACT's Spell
Timers (Options) form and search for matching spell timer name.</li>
<li>Right-click the&nbsp;<i>Timer or Tab Name</i>
to copy the timer to
the clipboard for sharing. Note that this will copy the first spell
timer found that matches that name if there are multiple timers with
the same name but different categories.</li>
<li>Perform an incremental search in the <i>Regular
Expression</i>,
<i>Alert</i>, and <i>Timer or Tab Name</i>
by entering text in the <i>Find:</i> box. The
[Enter] key or the double arrow button performs a 'find next'.</li>
</ul>
<li>Edit Trigger Dialog (double-click a trigger regular
expression)</li>
<ul>
<li>When editing a trigger's <i>Category / Zone</i>
or<i> Regular Expression</i>,
the dialog allows for replacing the original trigger or creating a new
trigger.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>If a line is copied from the<i> View Logs</i>,
it can be
properly formatted and pasted into the <i>Regular Expression</i>
using the
[Paste Clipboard] button in the trigger edit dialog.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Selecting text in the <i>Regular Expression</i>
and then
right-clicking allows replacing the selected text with a capture group.</li>
<li><i>Regular Expression</i> syntax is checked
as each character is
typed in the box. An invalid expression turns the text red. If one of
the dialog closing buttons (other than [Cancel]) is pressed when the
expression is invalid, an error popup is displayed giving more
information on the problem.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Capture groups can be easily inserted into the TTS
expression using the drop down list of capture names and the [Insert
capture name] button.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The [Search for spell timer] button will open ACT's Spell
Timers (Options) form and search for
matching spell timer name.<br>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The <i>Show Encounters</i>
checkbox&nbsp;will display a list of finished encounters. Selecting
an encounter will display
the log lines for that encounter, similar to ACT's <i>View Logs</i>.
The
dialog can be resized to see more of the log lines.</li>
<li>Display only matching log lines by entering <i>Filter:</i>
text.
&nbsp;Useful filters include '#' for showing colored lines and
'says,' for showing mob dialog.</li>
<li>Right click a log line for a context menu to format and
paste the line into the <i>Regular Expression</i>.</li>
<li>Right click a log line for a context menu to test the
trigger against the log line.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<u><a name="macro_share"></a>Sharing via an
EQII Macro</u><br>
Wouldn't it be nice to be able to share all triggers and their timers
for a zone in one
operation rather than copy-paste for each one? &nbsp;An EQII macro
can <i>almost</i> do it.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, EQII macros cannot handle all the XML encoding used in
shared triggers. Some of the problems can be avoided by changing the
trigger. Other problems simply prevent the trigger or spell timer from
being shared via a macro and it must be shared via the clipboard.
Prohibited characters are listed in
the tool tip for the&nbsp;<i>Share Macro</i> context
menus when macro share is
disabled.<br>
<br>
You might want to use a macro to share a trigger to avoid clipboard
problems such as the occasional clipboard failure or pasting the parse
into chat rather than the trigger.<br>
<br>
If a trigger can be saved in a macro, the 'macro play' icon is
displayed next to its checkbox. &nbsp;If the trigger has a <i>Timer
or Tab name</i> and the timer can be saved in a macro, the 'macro
play' button is displayed next to&nbsp;that checkbox.<br>
<br>
When a trigger&nbsp;can be saved in a macro, selecting the
trigger's <i>Raidsay Share Macro</i> or <i>Groupsay
Share Macro</i> context menu will create a triggers.txt file to
either /raidsay or /groupsay the shared trigger, respectively. If the
trigger has a timer that can be saved in a macro, the timer is also
written to the macro. To actually share the trigger in EQII, the user
would enter in an EQII chat box: <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/do_file_commands triggers.txt<br>
<br>
If a Category has one or more triggers that can be saved in a macro,
selecting the Category's <i>Raidsay Share Macro</i> or <i>Groupsay
Share Macro</i> context menu will create a triggers.txt file to
either /raidsay or /groupsay, respectively, all of the valid triggers
and their valid timers. Macros are limited to 16 lines.<br>
<br>
Following are some macro issues and any workaround:<br>
<ul>
<li>If the Category name contains any prohibited
characters, trigger macro share is disabled. There is no workaround.</li>
<li>If the trigger <i>Regular Expression</i>
contains prohibited
characters, it can often be rewritten to remove those characters. In
many cases the offending characters can just be removed from the
beginning or end of the trigger without affecting its usefulness.
Example alternate approaches or when that's not
feasable&nbsp;include:</li>
<ul>
<li><i>Praetorian K'Tikrn gets sick</i> : replace
the apostrophe with a wild card period, becoming : <i>Praetorian
K.Tikrn gets sick</i></li>
<li><i>prepares to unleash a mighty barrage in
(?&lt;player&gt;\w+)</i> : replace the named capture
group with a numbered capture group, becoming : <i>prepares to
unleash a mighty barrage in (\w+)</i></li>
<li><i>You have infected your enemies
with&nbsp;\\#FF0000Dark Incubation!</i>&nbsp;:
replace&nbsp;the \\ with a wild card period, becoming : <i>You
have infected your enemies with .#FF0000Dark Incubation!</i></li>
<li><i>\\#FF9900You feel energized by Crystalline
Destruction</i> : just remove the slashes, becoming : <i>#FF9900You
feel energized by Crystalline Destruction</i></li>
<li><i>&nbsp;says, ''Bring on the rocks</i><i>
: </i>replace the double quote with a wild card period, becoming
:<i> &nbsp;says, .Bring on the rocks</i><i><br>
</i></li>
</ul>
<li>If the trigger <i>Alert</i> or <i>Timer
or Tab name</i> contain prohibited
characters, they can often be written differently to exclude those
characters.</li>
<li>If the timer name, sounds, or tool tip contain prohibited
&nbsp;characters, they can often be written differently to exclude
those characters.</li>
<li>Note that if the timer Category contains prohibited
characters,
changing it may break functionality if the <i>Restrict to
category zone or mob</i> checkbox is checked.</li>
</ul>
